      <h3>Ayahuasca</h3>
      <p>Ayahuasca is an Amazonian plant mixture that is capable of inducing altered states of consciousness, usually lasting between 4 to 8 hours after ingestion. Ranging from mildly stimulating to extremely visionary, ayahuasca is used primarily as a medicine and as a shamanic means of communication, typically in a ceremonial session under the guidance of an experienced drinker.</p>

      <h3>Mescaline Cactus</h3>
      <p>Mescaline cacti play a very important role in Latin American shamanic culture. Mescaline is the psycho-active compound that induces intense visual effects and a strongly altered consciousness. The peyote (Lophophora williamsii) from Mexico is a well-known mescaline cactus. Besides the peyote there are other reknowned and lesser known species of mescaline cacti, such as the San Pedro (Echinopsis pachanoi) and the Peruvian Torch (Echinopsis Peruviana). </p>

      <h3>Iboga</h3>
      <p>Tabernanthe iboga or simply iboga is a perennial rainforest shrub and psychedelic, native to western Central Africa. Iboga stimulates the central nervous system when taken in small doses and induces visions in larger doses. In parts of Africa where the plant grows, the bark of the root is chewed for various pharmacological or ritualistic purposes. Ibogaine, the active alkaloid, is also used to treat substance abuse disorders and depression. A small amount of ibogaine, along with precursors of ibogaine, are found in Voacanga africana.</p>
